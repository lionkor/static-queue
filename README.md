# static-queue

A statically sized `no_std` queue implemented as a ring buffer.

Why? Because a `no_std`, non-allocating, fully safe rust and 100% line and branch coverage tested queue seemed like a nice idea! :)

- `no_std` compatible
- Safe rust
- No allocations
- 100% code test coverage (branch, function, line and region coverage)
